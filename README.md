# 2048-game
This version of 2048 builds upon the classic, intuitive gameplay, offering a rich, customizable, and user-friendly experience for both new players and seasoned veterans. Challenge your mind, master your strategy, and slide your way to victory.

How to Play

The goal is simple yet challenging: swipe to move all tiles on the board in any direction (up, down, left, or right). When two tiles with the same number touch, they merge into one, doubling their value (2+2=4, 4+4=8, and so on). Your objective is to skillfully combine tiles to reach the elusive 2048 tile—and see how far beyond you can go!
